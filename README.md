# Pizza-Sales-Analysis
Analysed the pizza Sales Data with Excel & Oracle SQL Database to get the figures of how the shop is working.
Visualised the data using Power BI and and ound out how the data is acting over a period of time.

Suggesions:-
1. We can see from the report that on the weekends friday/saturday are having the higest orders so on weekdays special offers can be give in order to increase the sales.
2. We can see that X-Large and XX-Large Pizzas are giving like 1.72% of the sales so we can exclude that from the menu and focus mainly on the other size of pizzas, which will eventually save the cost of the resources.
3. We can also see that in the winter season leaving the month of January there is less amount of sales and on the month of october the sales were the lowest.So, there can be two ways:-
      a. Either you give offers in that time which will attract more customers and increase sales or,
      b. you reduce inventory which will eventually reduce cost.
   My opinion is to go with the first one.
4. The Brie carre pizza is the lowest contributer to the revenue. So, it is best to give offers on this pizza or can be removed from the monue and give focus to the other pizzas.
